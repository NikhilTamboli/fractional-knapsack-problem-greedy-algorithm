# fractional-knapsack-problem-greedy-algorithm

Problem Description
Task-> The goal of this code problem is to implement an algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem.

Input Format-> The first line of the input contains the number 𝑛 of items and the capacity 𝑊 of a knapsack.
The next 𝑛 lines define the values and weights of the items. The 𝑖-th line contains integers 𝑣𝑖 and 𝑤𝑖—the
value and the weight of 𝑖-th item, respectively.

Output Format-> Output the maximal value of fractions of items that fit into the knapsack.


EXAMPLE:-
Input:
3 50
60 20
100 50
120 30

Output:
180.0000
